# Recommendations

- You can simulate 5:3 aspect ratio while using `ScaffoldOfClockWith5to3AspectRatio` Widget 
instead of `ScaffoldOfClock`.
- Recommended to run iPad Pro(12.9-inch) (3rd generation) - horizontally

# Special thanks to: 

- Łukasz who made the designs and Tomek from Visual Panda, 
- Paweł Rąbel for code review, 
- AppUnite for giving me the oppurtinity and support to create this project.
